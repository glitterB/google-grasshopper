Grasshopper was an app developed by Google that taught users to code with JavaScript. Available for IOS and Android operating systems, the program had aimed to teach with small "bite-size" coding lessons.The program got harder as it progressed, and upon finishing the program, the user was given a certificate of completion. Assessments were not required to gain the certificate of completion.[^1]

Unfortunately, Google is shutting down the **Grasshopper App**. But this repository is dedicated to share it's content.
